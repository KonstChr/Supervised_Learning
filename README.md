I got the idea and some guidance for the EDA from Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass" (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/) but the code is entirely written by me, and especially the Machin Learning part was a solo project. I uploaded this notebook to showcase my code-writing style and approach to Machine Learning problems.

Skills demonstrated: Cohort Analysis, Classification problems, Handling imbalanced Datasets
