# Supervised_Learning
A Supervised Learning Project from Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass" (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/) that I undertook as a means of revision and extra practice to supplement my Data Science Professional Diploma from Big Blue Data Academy.

Code is written by me. I got some ideas regarding the EDA phase from the course but all the code and especially Step 4 which is the Machine Learning part is entirely my own work
