# Supervised_Learning
Originally started as a Capstone Project for Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass" (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/). I did some changes and worked it my own way.

I got some ideas for the graphs from the course but the code is entirely mine and especially the Machine Learning phase was also mine and independent from the course.
