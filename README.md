# Supervised_Learning
Originally started as a Capstone Project for Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass" (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/). I did some changes and worked it my own way.

I got some ideas for the graphs from the course but the code is entirely written by me, and especially the Step 4 which is the Sampling and Machine Learning phase is 100% independent from the course. I uploaded this notebook to showcase my code-writing style and approach to Machine Learning problems.
